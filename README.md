# Zeta-Disease-Prediction
Mars Mission Control needs a good data-driven system for predicting Zeta Disease infection on the International Mars Colony. Use the `_zeta-disease_training-data_` dataset to build a model that can predict who will be infected by Zeta Disease. Apply your model to the `_zeta-disease_prediction-data_` dataset to predict who will be infected by Zeta Disease.
